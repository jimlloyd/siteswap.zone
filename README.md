siteswap.info
=============

A service for finding siteswap-bot GIFs on imgur by name.

The subreddit /r/juggling has a bot /u/siteswap-bot to generate animated GIFs for siteswaps, which are uploaded to imgur. The imgur URLs are standard shorted URLs with generated tokens such as [http://imgur.com/pdj5x7W]. The notation for the siteswap is available in as the title of the GIF, but there is no easy way to find the GIF for a given siteswap.

This service maintains an index of all siteswap-bot GIFs so that they can be found by name. When complete, it will be available at the domain [http://siteswap.info]. Initially it will only do one thing: Given an URL like [http://siteswap.info/531] it will redirect to imgur to show the siteswap **531**.
